# iOS SDK

The Project Rome APIs for iOS are divided into two main namespace groups targeting different functionality.

## iOS Device Relay

The Device Relay namespaces allow remote devices and applications to discover and connect with each other through remote app launching, app services and push notifications.

### Namespaces

#### [Base](relay/base/index.md)
#### [Commanding](relay/commanding/index.md)
#### [Core](relay/core/index.md)
#### [Discovery](relay/discovery/index.md)
#### [Hosting](relay/hosting/index.md)

## iOS Activities

The Activities namespaces contain APIs that allow an app to create and publish Windows-style Activities.

### Namespaces

#### [UserActivities](activities/useractivities/index.md)
#### [UserNotifications](activities/usernotifications/index.md)
