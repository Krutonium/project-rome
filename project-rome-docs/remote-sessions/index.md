# Remote Sessions

The Remote Sessions feature allows an app to connect to other devices through a session, either for explicit app-to-app messaging or for brokered exchange of system-managed data. Sessions can be created by any device on a supported platform, and other devices can request to join, including devices signed in by other users.
